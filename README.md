# Generator create-react-redux-app

This generator was orginally forked from
[generator-create-redux-app](https://github.com/jonidelv/generator-create-redux-app)
and has been adapted to the Cognite Way&trade;

> This generator adds **Redux**, **styled-components** and other useful
> libraries and tools on top of the most common React starter
> [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It
> also provides a folder structure and code style based on what is considered
> best practices. Below you will find some information on how to perform common
> tasks.
